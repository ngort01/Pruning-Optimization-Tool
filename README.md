Pruning-Optimization-Tool
=======

Reads a text file containing a qualitative description of spatial obects and their relations. Based on rules regarding the relations between the objects and graph analysis the optimal objects for grounding are choosen. Variables of these objects are replaced with constant values.

## How it works
* The information in the input file is translated into a weighted graph ```G = (V,E)``` where vertices ```v``` represent spatial objects and edges ```e``` represent relations between objects.
* Weights of the edges are based on the type of relation (e.g. centre, coincindent) they represent. Each vertex gets an score calculated from the weights of its edges.
* If possible the graph is decomposed into independent subgraphs.
* For each subgraph the two vertices with the highest score are grounded by fixing their coordinates.
* Depending on what object was grounded, other related objects may be grounded too. E.g. if point ```p(x,y)``` is coincident with the grounded line ```l``` with start point ```s(0,0)``` and end point ```e(1,0)```, we can also set ```p.y = 0```.

## Usage
```java -jar opt-tool.jar inputFile.txt outputFile.txt customWeights.properties```

```java -jar opt-tool.jar -help```

Parameters

    inputFile.txt               text file containing a qualitative description of spatial obects and their relations
    outputFile.txt              outputFile name
    customWeights.properties    .properties file specifying weights for some or all relations
    
    -help                       prints help
    
## Custom Weights
Edges of the graph get weighted depending on the relation they represent.
The default weights are:

    centre=3.0
    ec=5.0
    coincidentPP=1.0
    coincidentPL=3.0
    coincidentPC=1.0
    
You can override these values by passing your own ```.properties``` file to the tool, specifying weights as in the example above.
Your file may include all relations listed in the spatial ontology below or just a few. Relations that are not included get a weight of ```1.0```.

In case of the ```coincident``` relation you have to differentiate between 3 types:

    coincidentPP:   point, point coincidence
    coincidentPL:   point, line coincidence
    coincidentPC:   point, circle coincidence

## Spatial Ontology
Following objects and relations can be used in the input file.
